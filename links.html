	Dwarf Fortress was the 2006 Indy PC Game of the year at the 2006 <a href="http://gamerswithjobs.com/">Gamers With Jobs</a> Community Game of the Year Awards.  There are lots of interesting articles at their site, and they also have a podcast (on which both of us were <a href="http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/32977">interviewed by Julian Murdoch</a>).  It was our first live interview, so we kind of fell apart, he he he.

	Julian Murdoch also wrote an article about the game which appeared in <a href="http://www.gamesforwindows.com/en-US/Magazine/Pages/Subscribe.aspx">Games for Windows</a> magazine.  There was also a DF article in <a href="http://www.pcgamer.co.uk">PC Gamer UK</a> (which we've seen, thanks to Martin) and a <a href="http://www.pcpowerplay.com.au/games/index.php">PC Powerplay</a> article (which we haven't seen!).

We did a <a href="http://dubiousquality.blogspot.com/2007/01/dwarf-fortress-interview.html">two</a> <a href="http://dubiousquality.blogspot.com/2007/01/dwarf-fortress-interview-part-two.html">part</a> interview with him and his readers back in January of 2007.
