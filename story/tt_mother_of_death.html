<h3><story_title>Mother of Death</story_title></h3>
<h5><story_author>By Threetoe</story_author></h5>

<p class="story">
<story_intro>H</story_intro>
e stared up at the beauty above him.  Raven-colored hair fell over her face, framing cruel green eyes.  The corner of her mouth lifted slightly, smiling as she let out a sigh.  Slowly his hand crept along the floor.  Her eyes flashed.  He gasped as he felt the prick of her sword point.  A drop of blood formed on his throat as she kicked the sword away from his hand.  The warriors of the mead hall howled with approval.  The woman held out her hand and helped the bested man to his feet.  They joined the rest of the warriors, singing drunken songs into the night.
</p>
<p class="story">
She was called Fraidae, which in the language of the north meant Mother of Death.  Her young sons had died fighting the Halgrim, a clan that dwelt in the eastern hills.  On that day she took up the blade vowing to take vengeance.  In the years that had passed she had claimed many lives, calling out warriors and slaying them in single combat.  Now the Halgrim were on the run.  In the mead hall, Fraidae learned the last of the clansmen had taken refuge in the capital.  Fraidae called for brave men to put down the last of the cowardly villains.  Three men stepped forward, including the young man who was rubbing the wound at his neck.
</p>
<p class="story">
As they rode through the hills toward the capital, the youth stole glances at the warrior woman.  She wore black leather, decorated with designs in red paint.  The great sword Painbringer was slung across her back.  She turned to look at him and he turned away, hand at his throat.  The two bearded warriors howled with laughter.  
</p>
<p class="story">
"What is your name, boy?"  Fraidae asked the youth.
</p>
<p class="story">
"H… Hap," gulped the boy, painfully.
The warriors laughed.
</p>
<p class="story">
"Why do you quest with me?" asked the woman.
</p>
<p class="story">
"The Halgrim have wronged you, my lady!" shouted Hap.
A pause.  Hap glanced around anxiously.
</p>
<p class="story">
"And wronged the whole world by their foul deeds!" added the boy.
The warriors muttered to themselves.
</p>
<p class="story">
Smoke rose in great columns on the horizon.  The band made for the capital in great haste.  Every building in the capital had been razed to the ground.  Atop the ruins of the stone keep a great dragon beat its wings.  Huge jets of fire shot from its mouth, reigniting the charred ruins.  Fraidae rushed into the city, darting between buildings to avoid the dragon's gaze.  At last she found a survivor.
</p>
<p class="story">
"I seek the brothers Halgrim!" shouted Fraidae.
</p>
<p class="story">
"They are dead," croaked the dying man. "Everyone is dead."
</p>
<p class="story">
Fraidae looked up at the dragon.  It was taking the treasure of the keep into its mouth and throwing its head back to swallow it down.  Cursing with all her hatred, she made a new oath.  The dragon had robbed her of vengeance.  It must die.  When she told the warriors of her plan they went pale and made to leave.  She cursed them and questioned their manhood.  Soon they were on their way to the dragon's liar.  They changed their course to match the returning flights of the dragon as it flew back and forth carrying the treasure to its home.
</p>
<p class="story">
The adventurers climbed the rocky slope until they reached an enormous cavern entrance.  They felt radiating heat.  Inside they could hear the deep breathing of the dragon.   They crept inside.  Fraidae darted between the rocks.  She peered over a boulder and saw the dragon vomit a load of gold and jewels onto its mountain of treasure.  Fraidae gave a battle cry.  The three warriors answered her and together they charged the dragon.  The dragon turned and released a ball of fire.  The band separated and dodged behind piles of jewels.  One of the older warriors was not quick enough and was consumed by fire.  Fraidae charged over a pile of coins and attacked the dragon.
</p>
<p class="story">
For an hour Fraidae and her men battled the dragon.  They had been hiding behind piles of melting gold, when Hap gave a desperate scream and charged.  The dragon slapped him across the cavern with a swipe of its claw.  Fraidae held onto her fury and waited until the dragon moved away to consume its prey.  She watched the dragon carry the unconscious Hap to the center of the treasure pile.  Fraidae crept up behind the dragon.  She lifted Painbringer above her head.  As the dragon release Hap from its jaws, Fraidae let her sword fall and struck off the dragon's head.  The monster's body crashed to the ground and Fraidae rushed to Hap's aid.
</p>
<p class="story">
Then she saw them.  Two dragon hatchlings, the size of small bears, still surrounded by fragments of egg.  Hap lay only an arm's length away from them.  The tiny dragons pulled themselves forward, still unsteady on their feet.  Fraidae dropped her sword and slid into the nest.  The old warrior shouted after her.  As she pushed the boy out of the nest, one of the hatchlings caught her by the leg.  The warrior caught Hap under the arms and dragged him free.  The old adventurer looked back to Fraidae as she was dragged deeper into the nest.
</p>
<p class="story">
"Leave me," growled Fraidae. "The Mother is dead.  My work is done."

	<li>helping people stand, as a courtesy and in some cases this could be a belittling/dominant gesture</li>
	<li>physical attractiveness, can be based on cultural perceptions or intrinsic creature properties, this requires enough physical features to put in norms for each society/creature</li>
	<li>flourishes, stances, movement of physical features to set the tone in certain situations, there can also be more subtle expressions based on recent actions and thoughts</li>
	<li>different mobility status possibilities for newly born creatures, some can walk, some can walk with some instability, others cannot walk for a year or more</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>ITEMS
	<ul class="itemized">
	<li>melting materials and temperature stuff, somewhat like original armok but not as bugtacular</li>
	<li>coloration and designs on clothing and equipment using various media, including dyes and paints</li>
	<li>naming objects that aren't necessarily artifacts (already requested in dwarf mode, but could be in adv mode too)</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>ENVIRONMENT
	<ul class="itemized">
	<li>large piles of items can act as obstacles for visibility and projectiles</li>
	<li>your ability to view other armies on the map is enhanced if they are large flying creatures, weather dependent</li>
	<li>stealth actions -- if there is an expectation by another creature that you will not perform an action, you might have to perform a stealthy version of this action (even while not sneaking) in order to avoid its detection (and possible prevention), this implies that regular actions like picking things up can be interrupted by creatures opposing them</li>
	<li>can kick/push objects on the ground, in particular if a creature wants something and another creature doesn't want them to have it, the object could be kicked away, possibly into object nullifying terrain features</li>
	</ul></li>

	<ul class="itemized">
	<li>carefully preparing aimed power shots over time</li>
	<li>creatures can gasp when being strangled or when the neck is threatened</li>

	</ul></li>
<li>LANGUAGE
	<ul class="itemized">
	<li>adding linguistic color when emotions rise</li>
	<li>nervousness causing speech impediments</li>
	<li>blurting out your innermost thoughts at times, kind of gives the rest of the world telepathy on your a moment, with the associated responses</li>
	<li>you can question a creature's ability related to a task, and if the creature prides itself on this ability, it might be goaded into performing the task, whether the task is important or not, this is more likely to succeed if the task is something that they want to do but it's just a matter of morale</li>

<li>SCENARIOS
	<ul class="itemized">
	<li>people leaving the party when you are about to go on a new and crazy venture</li>
	<li>triggers related to traumatic incidents can bring back sensation to affected parts</li>
	<li>quests for vengeance don't just have to be for your old characters and adventuring partners, but they can be declared for any wrong</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>MAGIC
	<ul class="itemized">
	<li>vows can have a mythical aspect, depending on the setup of the universe, you could receive aid for making a vow but being punished for breaking it or for making trivial vows</li>
