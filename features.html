	</p>
	<ul class="itemized">

		<li>The world persists as long as you like, over many games, recording historical events and tracking changes.</li>
		<li>Command your dwarves as they search for wealth in the mountain.
		<ul class="subitemized">
			<li>Craft treasures and furniture from many materials and improve these objects with precious metals, jewels and more.</li>

			<li>Accept non-dwarven residents from all over the world as your reputation grows.</li>
			<li>Surgery, sutures, splints, crutches and more:  care for your wounded dwarves instead of leaving them to fend for themselves.</li>
