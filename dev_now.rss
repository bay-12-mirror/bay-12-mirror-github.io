      <description xml:space="preserve">(Toady One)(Threetoe) It's miserable news but some of you will want to know.  On Wednesday morning, we took Scamps in to the vet after a sudden deterioration and it turned out to be widespread lymphoma.  He passed away Wednesday afternoon.  He was a good baby man and will be missed very much.
