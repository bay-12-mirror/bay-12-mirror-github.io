Sound note:  some lawnmower noises start increasing around 9 minutes in and persist for a few minutes, getting louder, but fortunately by ~15 they go mostly away, ha ha, so hopefully it isn't too distracting overall.  They'd been landscaping/painting/etc. my apartment consistently for a month, so it was hard to record around.  There's also a bit of microphone crackle I couldn't edit out easily, especially near the end.  It's a continuing process!
