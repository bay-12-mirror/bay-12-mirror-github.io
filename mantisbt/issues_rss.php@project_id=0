&lt;br /&gt;
The obvious problem is that because this, you cannot pre-define a specific [UNIQUE_DEMON] to take over the specific entity at gamestart which is the only time they could or manifest again later in a deep-disaster. Rendering accessibility to the token redundant as lowering demons to 1 will still install randomly generated demons instead, and 0 will prevent the dark fortress from spawning totally until a later rising from a deep disaster.]]></description><category>Civilizations/Entities -- General</category><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:52:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11775</guid><comments>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11775#bugnotes</comments></item><item><title>0011875: Forgotten Beast that created a false identity that became it's own unique entity in legends and world gen</title><author></author><link>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11875</link><description><![CDATA[Here is the save: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=15963&quot;&gt;https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=15963&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=15963&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;^&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Gedor Echoprofaned became Arane Earthenringed. Both share the false identity of Vabok Anvilromance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are all the same person although legends separates Gedor and Arane. To the extent that Arane developed unique world gen events as an elf including marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The forgotten beast essentially behaves as a regular villain in world gen. He managed to trick Legends Mode into thinking his false identity was a real one]]></description><category>Legends Mode -- Historical Figures</category><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 19:04:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11875</guid><comments>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11875#bugnotes</comments></item><item><title>0011874: Roads don't remember when they are created.</title><author></author><link>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11874</link><description><![CDATA[In Legends mode, while viewing historical map, roads are always displayed.

It seems like most of the time it crashes when there is a big ocean on the map (that's what i'm looking for cause I try to reproduce mediterranean world.)]]></description><category>World Generation -- Parameters</category><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 11:37:49 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11135</guid><comments>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11135#bugnotes</comments></item><item><title>0010081: "cancels unchain pet: no building" Spam</title><author></author><link>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=10081</link><description><![CDATA[&quot;cancels unchain pet: no building&quot; Spam when the dwarf tryes to collect it's war dog.]]></description><category>Dwarf Mode -- Buildings, Cages and Chains</category><pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2022 12:47:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=10081</guid><comments>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=10081#bugnotes</comments></item><item><title>0011865: Glazing jobs produce meal quality descriptors instead of standard quality descriptors</title><author></author><link>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11865</link><description><![CDATA[When glazing clay objects at a kiln, the product descriptions end up using meal quality descriptors instead of the standard quality adjectives, eg. &quot;exceptionally-prepared ash glaze&quot; instead of &quot;exceptional ash glaze&quot;.

It seems (based on investigation with placing things inside other things until full + looking at sizes in DFhack) that the size and capacity of tools are 1/10th their raw-defined amounts.&lt;br /&gt;
Examples:&lt;br /&gt;
- A bucket has a capacity of 600, but it's able to fit 6 display cases (supposedly 1000 in size each) before becoming full.&lt;br /&gt;
- A pouch has a supposed capacity of 1000, but can't fit in a bucket (which has a volume of 300). Nor can it fit any non-tool item more than 100 in size before becoming full.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It could be that this is intended, and that it's just the explanation on the wiki of what the SIZE and CONTAINER_CAPACITY values are supposed to represent that's wrong. If that's true though, then some of the numbers chosen seem a little off - it's hard to imagine that a six-sided die in the DF universe is supposed to be ~8mm per side.]]></description><category>Items</category><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 08:03:35 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11863</guid><comments>http://bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=11863#bugnotes</comments></item></channel></rss>
