<h5>Overview</h5>

<p>
The long-term goal is to create a fantasy world simulator in which it is possible to take part in a rich history, occupying a variety of roles through the course of several games.  Dwarf Fortress has been in development on-and-off since 2002 and consistently since 2006.  The game is designed by Tarn and Zach Adams.  Fan suggestions are welcome.  The suggestion forum can be found <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=5.0">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
It has also proven too time-consuming to maintain all of the notes in a presentable form, so we're sticking with incomplete lists for the foreseeable future.  This page doesn't represent everything we'd like to do.  It just has some of the things we're thinking about doing sooner rather than later.  We'll be adding to it as specific roadmaps are drawn up and we are closer to using them.  There is <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696">a discussion thread</a> on the forum.

<h5>Upcoming Development</h5>

<p>
Our next major goal is to add creation myth and magic system generation.  There are some things to do first, though!  We need to finish the graphical/usability update for the Steam/itch release.  After that, we're going to finish some delayed features from the first villain release along with doing work on some army/siege features and other matters (listed below.)  The hope is that all of this will sustain us through a necessary map rewrite, a key part of the initial myth/magic release which will unavoidably take a long time, no matter how the rest can be portioned between releases.
</p>
<p>
Once we're ready, we'll do myth and magic additions until we reach a satisfactory point (some options below, we won't get to everything).  After the magic releases, we'll do a lot of foundational work culminating in starting scenarios for your fortresses.  These changes touch upon law, property, status, diplomacy and so on, which will position us for economic work and thief role development, though we haven't committed to a direction beyond the three sections below.  We'll be fixing bugs and making smaller changes between major releases.

<h5>Development Lists</h5>

<p>
Below are the things we'll be working on after the ordered list has been handled.  The idea for the much-neglected adventure mode is to focus on facilitating some specific roles that should be fun by themselves but especially when taken together.  The named roles are for planning purposes only, not for use in the game explicitly.  Dwarf mode will see a round of fan-suggested improvements as well as interaction with the upcoming adventure mode villains, raiders, etc.  The lists below are <i>unordered</i>.
